Hi, my name is Cooper Illes, and every summer for the past eleven years I've attended a small all-boys camp in Ontario called Ponacka. I love summer camp so much, it holds such a dear spot in my heart, for all the fun I've had, for all the things I've learned, and all the interesting people I've met. In fact, I think every child should attend a summer campb at least once in their lives as it teaches invaluable lessons about independence, cooperation, resilience, and leadership, which is what I would like to focus on today.

While I have a great appreciation for my time as a camper, when I think of Ponacka, the first thing that comes to mind is my experience as a counselor, which has taught me everything I know about effective leadership. My first lesson in leadership came during the third night of my first year as a counselor (2 years ago) when I had to comfort a homesick camper in tears. After unsuccessfully trying to comfort him for a few minutes, I thought about how I felt when I was in his position and what I wanted to hear then. The words flowed easily as I told him about how homesick I felt during my first few years at camp, and explained strategies I had used to overcome it. As we discussed ideas to distract himself from thinking of home, the camper slowly regained himself and returned to bed. Through this experience, I learned that when someone is upset, a leader must approach them as a peer and talk to them on their level. This was a turning point in my confidence, as I realized that a strong leader is as a **comforting and relatable figure to those in need.**

As I gained confidence in my abilities, I realized that the campers' actions and attitudes mimicked mine. If I were honest with them, they would be honest with each other; if I treated them with respect, they would in turn treat each other with respect.  So, based on my experience as a camp counselor, I concluded that effective leaders must not only have a comforting and relatable attitude, but must also serve as a moral figure to those below him or her. 

So, to elect an effective leader means to elect a figure who can provide comfort and help to those below, having gone through similar experiences. Then why is our government so ineffective? Why does it fail to unite us against common enemies like fentanyl and coronavirus? The answer is a multitude of reasons, but I specifically think the root cause comes from a lack of relatable and empathetic leadership. Just as a camp counselor must understand and relate to the campersâ€™ challenges to effectively guide them, so too must political leaders understand the everyday experiences of their constituents. Instead, many of today's leaders exist in an elitist "bubble", disconnected from the everyday struggles of the average consumer. For example, our nation's top politicians fail to address rising grocery prices because they don't interact with the everyday prices of produce and dairy, unlike the majority of our country.

Without leaders who can connect with people on a human level, inspire mutual respect, and embody the values they wish to see in their communities, our society struggles to come together to solve its most pressing issues. Ultimately, effective leadership - whether in a summer camp or a government - requires more than power or authority. It demands empathy, shared experiences, and a commitment to others.
