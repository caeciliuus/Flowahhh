# Given Info
- Identify no fewer than three but no more than four examples of reactions to violence that you have encountered so far in this class. Compare and contrast the situations that the authors describe and the ways they respond and urge others to respond to similar situations. 
- Can you sort these examples into categories or metaphorical buckets? How would you do so? What would you call them? What looks the same to you? What looks different? 
- This speech will be 4–5 minutes long. Students will give this speech on Mar. 11 and 13, 2025

# I. Paul, Acceptance -> LOSS OF HOPE, TRUST
- Shattered ideals - **betrayal, loss of trust and hope for his future**
- **Disillusionment with Authority:** Paul and his classmates once felt proud to enlist, trusting those older voices. But after witnessing shellfire, filth, and constant danger, Paul bitterly realizes how naïve they all were:
	- He feels these “trusted” adults have betrayed him, robbing him of the ideals he had as a student
- **Home leave & pain of going back**
	- **Reunion with Family**: Paul’s mother is ill, yet tries to feed him his favorite meals, and his father wants him to wear his uniform proudly around town. Paul, however, cannot abide people’s well-meaning questions or patriotic chatter.
	- **Paul’s Old Bedroom**: He finds his books and childhood objects alien; his pre-war identity feels so distant that he cannot reconnect with it.
- **Why Paul Prefers War to Home**: Among comrades, Paul does not need to explain his nightmares; they all live the same horror and understand each other’s trauma without words. Facing family members who don’t—and can’t—comprehend the front only magnifies his sense of isolation.
	- After an awkward stay at home, Paul dreads the pity and clueless enthusiasm he encounters, concluding it’s easier to return to his unit than to pretend everything can be “normal” again.
	- This gap between home and the trenches drives home the idea that there is no coherent “next chapter” for him.
- **Loss of hope**
	- “What will happen to us when it is all over?”
	- Earlier in the story, Paul remembers classmates who dreamed of returning to school or finishing exams once the war ended. Over time, those hopes fade. This contrast (Müller’s almost stubborn academic habit vs. Paul’s growing indifference) underscores Paul’s view that any future beyond the front is a fantasy.

# II. Elie, Acceptance -> LOSS OF FAITH
- Gradual, you can see him slowly questioning his beliefs as he's subjected to observing horrific events
- Initially very devout and due to this, the horrors strike directly at the core of who he is
- Elie does not choose to let go of faith lightly; the sheer scale of suffering tears it from him.
1. Infants burning at Birkenau
2. "Where is God" after child hanging, "he is hanging here, on this gallows" -> faith in God doesn't just waver, it nearly breaks
3. Calls himself the accuser and God the accused during Rosh Hashanah - blames God for not intervening 
4. Sees survival as purely physical and mechanical rather than a spiritual experience guided by a benevolent path
5. Must redefine who he is
# Gandhi, Resistance -> FREEDOM
- Colonial context
- "**Satyagraha**" (truth force) as a means to resist oppression without harm
	- Gandhi insists nonviolence is not weakness but a profound moral statement—“an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.”
	- 
- Rather than accepting injustice or fighting back, Gandhi engages in *active nonviolence*
- **Noncooperation**
	- By boycotting British institutions (schools, courts, goods), Indians withdraw their “cooperation” with illegitimate authority
	- Gandhi’s method included openly breaking unjust laws (e.g., the Salt March defying salt taxes) and _accepting_ the legal consequences
- **Examples**
	- **Salt March**: Gandhi and followers march to the sea to make their own salt, openly defying British salt taxes and monopoly
	- **Boycotts & Swadeshi Movement**: Encouraging Indians to use homemade goods rather than British imports
