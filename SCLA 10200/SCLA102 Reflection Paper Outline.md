# Given
How would you react amid total war? Base your response on your readings so far this term. Explain your perspective by writing in the first person and by referring to specific, concrete examples from the assigned course materials.
- Make a clear main point and relevant sub-points that respond directly to the prompt;
- Draw thoughtfully and persuasively on concrete evidence from the course materials;
- Cite these source materials consistently and accurately;
- Implement a clear structure that connects the main point to relevant subsidiary points and supporting evidence;
- Organize the text in complete sentences and coherent paragraphs, including effective transitions between different ideas; 
- Demonstrate original, creative thinking about the course themes and their relevance to our own lives and lived experiences; 
- Utilize standard, consistent spelling and grammar.
# Moral Conflict
- First-person explanation of your internal debate: Why it feels morally difficult to let peers serve while you remain safe.
- Why a sense of duty, loyalty, or patriotism weighs heavily in your decision-making process.
- Link to *[[All Quiet on the Western Front.pdf|AQOTWF]]*: Paul’s acute moral torment when he is forced to kill a French soldier (around Chapter 9). He moves from robotic self-preservation to deep regret and empathy for the man’s family → this scene shows the intense inner struggle of a soldier who never truly wanted to kill anyone.
	- While Paul fights only because he was drafted and conditioned to do so, you wrestle with whether you’d even stay to face the draft
# Guilt & Family Struggles
- **Leaving Family vs. Leaving Others to Fight**: first-person description of the tug-of-war: guilt for putting parents through worry if you enlist, versus guilt for staying home (or emigrating) while friends risk their lives.
- Link to *[[All Quiet on the Western Front.pdf|AQOTWF]]*: Paul’s leave in Chapter 7, where he feels alienated from family and home. He returns to find his mother ill, and he can’t bring himself to share the war’s horrors → illustrates how duty to loved ones can be overshadowed by the trauma of war, causing guilt in both directions
	- Paul’s inability to confide in his parents magnifies his guilt—he feels he’s abandoned them emotionally, even while physically present
- Quotes
	- "I feel agitated; but I don’t want to be, because it isn’t right. I want to get that quiet rapture back… Please let the wind of desire…carry me back…"
		- Paul returns home only to find he no longer fits in. He feels guilty for being unable to reconnect with his loved ones. This passage underscores the emotional barrier the war has created
	- strain of departure: p. 155–156, Chapter 7
	- “I lean against the wall and grip my helmet and my rifle…nothing has any power against [my sister’s greeting]. I try with all my might to force myself to laugh and to speak, but I can’t manage a single word.”
	- “Words, words, words—they can’t reach me… I stand silent in front of them, as if I were on trial.”
# Hopelessness for the future
- Root causes of hopelessness: **(1)** disillusionment with world leaders who repeatedly fail to prevent devastating conflicts; **(2)** fear that another war might come again, making you wonder if the cycle ever truly ends.
- Link to *[[All Quiet on the Western Front.pdf|AQOTWF]]*: As Paul and his comrades watch older men in positions of power negotiate and mislead, they become convinced that the younger generation’s lives are simply expendable. Many passages (e.g., Paul’s reflections in Chapters 5–6) convey the sense that the “lost generation” has no real future to look forward to -> - - soldiers are convinced that if such wars keep happening, there is no meaningful future for them.
- *note:* be careful not to overshadow your personal perspective with overly broad political statements. Integrate your concerns about global leadership directly into your own dilemma—how it affects your decision to stay or emigrate.
