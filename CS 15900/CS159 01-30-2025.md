slight confusion:
-post/pre increment
-format specifiers/flags etc.

mixed data type expressions? `3.1 / 2` 'unsafe conversion' -> computer automatically uses `long` to turn `int x = 2` -> `int x = 2.0` 
'implicit type conversion' b/c compiler does it for you. always go upwards

explicit type conversion / 'type casting': `(float) 3 / 2` -> `3.0 / 2.0`. `(float)` operation specifies `3` to be converted into a float. only one `(float)` is needed in an expression

truncation: removing the entire decimal

`floor()` function goes down to lowest integer value, remove fraction. `floor(6.99) = 6`. vice versa w/ `ceil()` function. works w/ doubles. casting just drops the decimal, `ceil()` / `floor()` drops it in a specific way (the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG way?)

assignment type conversion (potential to be unsafe). done by the compiler

```C
int x;
x = 3.0 / 2; // implicit conversion 2 -> 2.0 // 
>> x = 1.5 // x is now a float
```

**avoid data loss -> this is unsafe**: 
```C
x = 1.5;
x = (int) 1.5;
>> x = 1 // data loss
```

how the value of variables are changed
-the assignment operator -> simple/compound assignment
-`scanf()`
-pre/postfix increment, decrement

**selection via calculation:** method of problem solving
1. create a factor that can be activated `(1)` or deactivated `(0)`
2. multiply the expression by a factor to decide its contribution to the final calculation
3. factor is usually determined by comparing more than one value (bruh what the fuck is she on about)
4.
