```
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
int counter = 0;
printf("Helloworld!\n");
return(0);
}
```

`return(0);` tells the computer that the main function is completed 
`;` means end of line

add comments with `/* */` , tells human readers what's going on. use `//` for single line comments. useful for making certain lines of code nonfunctional
- comments can appear anywhere. **all variables must be commented on in cs159**
	- include assignment header: `:hlb` for labs & `:hhw` for homework                           

rules regarding the selection of an identifier:
- first character must be alphabetical 
- must consist only of alphabetic characters, digits, underscores

what is determined by data type?
- amount of memory
- how a value of a given type is stored
- which operations can be performed on the value

data types
- integer (`int`) $\in[-2M,2M]$
- character (`char`) -> ASCII table 
- boolean (`bool`) stores true/false, **0/1 operations**
- floating points (`float`) stores fractions
- **data type of a variable cannot be changed** 

variable is a memory location that has a data type
- declaration gives the variable a name -> who?
- definition reserves memory for the variable -> what 
- course standard
  -  declare only a single variable per line -> `int x;`
