expressions in c contain operators (action to be taken) and operands (receiver of action) 
operator precedence is same as PEMDAS but execution is still sequential. see operator precedence @ last page of textbook

simple assignment: left operand equals right operand, `z=x+y` -> `z=1=2` 
compound assignment: left operand is updated by right operand, `x+=y` means increment `x` by `y` 
the `+` in `x+=y` can be replaced by any other operator

if `int x = 5`, then `x/=2`. we don't have an int w/ 3 and we can't have an int w/ 2.5 so we settle for x=2
7 mod 4 = $\frac{3}{4}$, only works w/ integers and chars (chars have int. values)
`x/=x+y` -> $\frac{x}{(x+y)}$ not $\frac{x}{x}+y$ because addition/subtraction have higher precedence than compound assignment

post-fix expression: `x++;` -> increment x by 1, also works w/ `(-)`
- increment happens AFTER the equals sign, at the semicolon: `a=x++`
pre-fix expression: `++x;` 
- increment x by 1 immediately 

```C
x = 0;
a = x++ // A = x = 0 then A = x++ = 1
```

to use `++` or `--` with any variable, it can only appear **once** in a given statement 

$\frac{z}{c}=\frac{x^2}{b^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}$ -> elliptical paraboloid 
$\frac{z}{c}=\frac{x^2}{b^2}-\frac{y^2}{a^2}$ -> hyperbolic paraboloid
$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$ -> hyperboloid of one sheets
$-\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$ -> hyperboloid of two sheets
$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=\frac{z^2}{c^2}$ -> cone
