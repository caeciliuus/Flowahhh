# Notes
## Epicureanism and friendship
- Torquatus claims to be responding to his critic, who had objected that if pleasure is the highest good there cannot be room for friendship at all
	- 
# What lessons can modern society learn from the ancient debate between Cicero and the Epicureans about the true nature and purpose of friendship?
#### 1. The Friendship Debate:
- Epicureans viewed friendship primarily as instrumentally valuable - useful for security and pleasure
- Cicero argued friendship must be based on virtue and genuine concern for others, not utility
- This reflects a deeper disagreement about whether self-interest or virtue should be the foundation of human relationships
#### 2. The underlying philosophical tensions include:

- Whether pleasure (Epicureans) or virtue (Cicero) should be life's highest goal
- Individual tranquility vs. civic duty
- Private vs. public life
- Self-interest vs. altruism in human relationships
#### 3. This debate remains relevant today in questions like:
- Are modern friendships becoming too transactional?
- Should we prioritize personal well-being over civic engagement?
- How do we balance self-interest with genuine care for others?
- What makes relationships authentic in an age of social networking?
