	### I. Passion vs. Purity in _Hippolytos_

#### **Hippolytos’ Chastity and Devotion to Artemis**

- **Hippolytos as a Symbol of Purity**: Hippolytos, the protagonist of Euripides' tragedy, is portrayed as a devout follower of the goddess Artemis, the deity associated with chastity, hunting, and purity. His commitment to remaining celibate is rooted in his belief that sexual desire is a corrupting force that threatens the moral integrity of individuals. In this way, Hippolytos functions as a paragon of _sophrosyne_—a Greek concept signifying self-control and temperance. He strives to live a life devoid of passion, which he views as a weakness.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Early in the play, Hippolytos reveals his disdain for Aphrodite, the goddess of love, by stating, “Because I prize my purity, I keep clear of her”【9:2†hippolytos.pdf.pdf】. This line underscores his refusal to acknowledge the power of love and sexual desire, instead aligning himself with Artemis, a virgin goddess who shares his values of purity and restraint.
    - **Analysis**: Hippolytos’ choice to reject Aphrodite is not merely a personal preference but a philosophical stance. He views chastity as a form of higher virtue, one that protects him from the chaos and moral compromise associated with love and lust. However, his extreme devotion to purity sets him apart from the social norms of his time, leading to isolation. This pursuit of moral superiority comes across as arrogance to those around him, including his own family. His rejection of Aphrodite can be seen as both a spiritual commitment and a fatal flaw, as his inability to engage with human emotions ultimately contributes to his downfall. Hippolytos’ rigidness and moral absolutism create the conditions for tragedy, as he is unable to navigate the complexities of human relationships and the gray areas of morality.

#### **Phaidra’s Struggle with Passion and Its Consequences**

- **Phaidra as the Victim of Passion**: In contrast to Hippolytos' rejection of passion, Phaidra, his stepmother, is consumed by a powerful and forbidden desire for him, instilled in her by Aphrodite as part of the goddess’s revenge against Hippolytos. Phaidra's desire is portrayed as uncontrollable and shameful, leading her to experience intense guilt and self-loathing. Her character embodies the destructive potential of passion when it is unfulfilled or repressed, showing how desire can lead to psychological torment and moral conflict.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Phaidra's internal conflict is made evident when she confesses, "My hands are clean— / the crime is in my heart"【9:2†hippolytos.pdf.pdf】. This line reveals her struggle with the fact that, although she has not acted on her feelings, the mere existence of such passion makes her feel morally tainted. Her sense of purity is compromised by the emotions she cannot control, and her desire for Hippolytos becomes a source of profound shame.
    - **Analysis**: Phaidra's passion for Hippolytos represents a direct challenge to the ideals of chastity and purity that he embodies. While she tries to suppress her feelings to preserve her honor and protect her family, the pressure of repression eventually drives her to suicide. The play emphasizes how passion, when denied an outlet, can become destructive. Phaidra’s tragic end demonstrates that suppressing or ignoring such powerful human emotions can lead to devastating consequences. Euripides uses Phaidra’s character to explore the darker side of love and desire, showing how passion can corrupt the mind and soul, especially when it conflicts with societal and moral expectations. Her death, precipitated by her inability to reconcile her passion with her sense of honor, serves as a grim reminder of the dangers of repressed desire.

### II. Passion and Betrayal in _Desire Under the Elms_

#### **Abbie and Eben’s Illicit Passion**

- **Abbie and Eben’s Affair as a Rebellion Against Patriarchal Control**: In _Desire Under the Elms_, Eugene O’Neill presents a different dynamic of passion, where love and desire act as forces of rebellion rather than moral corruption. Abbie, the new wife of the elderly Ephraim Cabot, and Eben, Ephraim's son, engage in a passionate and illicit love affair that represents their resistance against Ephraim’s tyrannical control over the family and land. Abbie’s love for Eben is an attempt to secure her future within the Cabot family, while Eben’s passion for her stems from a mix of attraction and deep-seated resentment toward his father.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Abbie’s declaration, "I'll sing fur ye! I'll die fur ye!"【9:9†desire-under-the-elms.pdf】, reveals the intensity of her feelings for Eben, portraying her love as both desperate and all-consuming. Her passion for Eben leads her to commit unspeakable acts, including the murder of their newborn child, which she believes will secure her relationship with Eben permanently.
    - **Analysis**: The passion between Abbie and Eben is portrayed as both liberating and destructive. Unlike Hippolytos and Phaidra, who are trapped by their conflicting feelings of purity and desire, Abbie and Eben fully indulge in their passion. However, this indulgence leads to the betrayal of Ephraim and the ultimate destruction of the family. The affair between Abbie and Eben symbolizes their desire to break free from the oppressive hold of Ephraim and take control of their own destinies. Yet, in doing so, they destroy the very foundation of the family. Their passion, while initially empowering, becomes a force of annihilation as it leads to infanticide and the disintegration of the Cabot household.

#### **Eben’s Complicated Relationship with Passion and Vengeance**

- **Eben’s Dual Motive: Love and Revenge**: Eben’s relationship with Abbie is driven not only by passion but also by a deep desire for revenge against his father, Ephraim. Eben’s mother, who died before the events of the play, serves as a powerful influence on his feelings toward both his father and Abbie. Eben views his affair with Abbie as a way to avenge his mother, whom he believes was mistreated by Ephraim.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Eben’s complicated feelings toward Abbie and his mother are evident when he exclaims, “It’s her vengeance on him—so’s she kin rest quiet in her grave!”【9:9†desire-under-the-elms.pdf】. This line shows how Eben’s passion for Abbie is intertwined with his unresolved emotions toward his deceased mother, and how his desire for vengeance becomes entangled with his love for Abbie.
    - **Analysis**: Eben’s passion is not purely romantic; it is also a vehicle for his emotional and psychological conflict with his father. His affair with Abbie represents a complex mix of love, resentment, and revenge. In this way, O’Neill explores the theme of passion as a destructive force, not only in the context of romantic relationships but also within familial dynamics. Eben’s passion for Abbie becomes a way for him to assert his independence and reclaim what he believes his father took from him. However, this passion ultimately leads to tragedy, as it blinds him to the moral consequences of his actions, much like Phaidra’s blinding passion in _Hippolytos_.

### III. Consequences of Passion in Both Plays

#### **The Tragic Outcomes in _Hippolytos_**

- **The Destruction of Innocence and Family**: In _Hippolytos_, the consequences of unchecked passion are devastating for both the title character and his family. Phaidra’s unrequited love for Hippolytos leads to her suicide, but not before she falsely accuses him of attempting to seduce her, which prompts Theseus to curse his son. Theseus’ rash decision, driven by the belief that his son betrayed him, results in Hippolytos’ death, completing the cycle of destruction caused by passion.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Artemis laments the tragic outcome of these events, remarking, “sophrosyne is simply unable to save Hippolytos; it cannot cope successfully with the passions of his father, his stepmother”【9:17†hippolytos.pdf.pdf】. Despite Hippolytos’ dedication to purity, he cannot escape the consequences of Phaidra’s uncontrollable desire.
    - **Analysis**: Euripides portrays passion as a destructive force that operates outside the bounds of logic and morality. Even Hippolytos, who strives to remain untouched by Aphrodite’s influence, is ultimately brought down by the very passions he sought to avoid. The play suggests that no amount of purity or moral superiority can protect individuals from the chaotic and often destructive power of human emotions. Theseus’ misplaced trust in Phaidra’s false accusation and his impulsive punishment of Hippolytos highlight the dangers of acting on emotion without seeking the truth. The tragic irony of Hippolytos’ death reinforces the idea that passion, whether embraced or rejected, has the power to destroy lives and families.

#### **Familial Ruin in _Desire Under the Elms_**

- **Infanticide and the Collapse of the Cabot Family**: In _Desire Under the Elms_, the consequences of passion are equally tragic, though the focus is more on the destruction of family relationships than on individual moral downfall. Abbie’s passion for Eben leads her to murder their newborn child in an attempt to prove her love for him, a decision that shocks and horrifies Eben. The murder of the child represents the ultimate act of betrayal, not only against Ephraim but also against the natural bonds of motherhood and family.
    - **Textual Evidence**: Abbie’s desperation is evident when she cries, “I'll take yer Maw's place! I'll be everythin' she was t' ye!”【9:9†desire-under-the-elms.pdf】, as she attempts to fill the emotional void left by Eben’s mother. However, her actions only deepen the tragedy, as her love for Eben becomes intertwined with violence and loss.
    - **Analysis**: O’Neill portrays passion as a force that disrupts the natural order of the family. The infanticide, an unspeakable act, symbolizes the total breakdown of familial bonds. Just as Hippolytos’ family is destroyed by misdirected passion in Euripides’ play, the Cabot family is torn apart by the illicit love between Abbie and Eben. The consequences of their affair are not limited to personal loss but extend to the disintegration of the entire family structure, leaving Ephraim, Abbie, and Eben broken and isolated. The play’s exploration of passion as a source of destruction mirrors the themes in _Hippolytos_, suggesting that love and desire, when pursued recklessly, can lead to irrevocable harm.
