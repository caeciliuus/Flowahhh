- Aphrodite takes revenge on Hippolytos for giving Artemis more attention by infecting Phaidra, Hippolytos' stepmom, with desire for Hippolytos
	- Announces she will commit suicide from shame after framing Hippolytos so that Theseus will utter a fatal curse in anger
- Hippolytos enters in poetic hymn in praise of Artemis, then places crown on a statue of her 
	- Servant tells Hippolytos he's being disrespectful and must also worship the statue of Aphrodite. Hippolytos spurns Aphrodite and leaves 
- Chorus sings that Phaidra hasn't eaten for 3 days & longs for death, suffering from an illness she refuses to reveal
- Phaidra desires to go to a grassy meadow / forest, places in which Hippolytos hunts
- the nurse mentions to Phaidra that if she dies, her husband’s bastard child, [Hippolytus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hippolytus/characters/hippolytus), will inherit everything, while her own beloved children will suffer deeply from her absence. The mere mention of Hippolytus’ name causes Phaidra to groan, which the nurse notes with interest.
- Phaidra references her family's history of desire, noting her mother becoming overcome by desire for a bull
- When the nurse figures out the truth, wishes for the end of her own life, so great is Phaidra’s crime, and mentions [Aphrodite’s](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hippolytus/characters/aphrodite) great power
- Shame, she says, is a good thing, so long as it encourages “purity of soul” and action in accordance with the world. For that reason, she consigned herself to silence and death when she felt her growing desire for [Hippolytus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hippolytus/characters/hippolytus). That is the essential law of a woman’s life in aristocratic circles: to protect one’s public image. Otherwise, she says, her children cannot lead the lives she hopes for them, because a mother’s disgrace infects an entire family.
- Nurse changes her approach & encourages an affair w/ Hippolytos to save her life. Claims she knows of magic medicine to cure the sickness, needs hair/piece of clothing from Hippolytos
	- nurse utters a secret prayer asking Aphrodite to help her achieve success in her secret plan.
- The Koryphaios gets her at last to describe what she’s hearing: it’s Hippolytus “in a huge fury”, shouting vicious slurs against some woman. The Koryphaios helps Phaidra realize that the nurse has told Hippolytus her secret, who in turn ferociously denounces her
	- Worried that Hippolytus will spread the secret even further, she reminds him of the oath of silence that he swore before hearing of Phaidra’s desire. In response, Hippolytus launches into a huge rant outlining his hatred for women. He characterizes them as a constant ruin to their family, always motivated by their sexuality and looking for adultery
- Chorus (Koryphaios) tells Phaidra that an innocent civilian will die when she does
- Phaidra hangs herself right before Theseus arrives w/ crown of flowers, indicating the oracle gave him good news
	- The contrast between the oracle’s good omen – symbolized by the crown of flowers Theseus is wearing – and the Phaidra’s death, which Theseus first learns about here, creates a moment of irony.
	- Theseus, in anguish, says that Phaidra’s death robs him of his own life. He then blames what has happened on some ancient crime committed by a member of his family, for which the cycle of death and revenge continues to claim victims. And he also repeats that he does not know precisely what caused her death.
- Phaidra has a tablet @ her dead body accusing Hippolytos of raping her then spread the rumor around, then prays to Poseidon to use up one of Theseus’ three mortal curses by killing Hippolytus
	- Koryphaios wants to tell the whole truth in order to calm Theseus’ anger, but instead can only hint that there is a truth that she cannot reveal, because of the oath she swore to Phaidra.
