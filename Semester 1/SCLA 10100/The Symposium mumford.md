`So it seems to me, Phaedrus, that Love is himself supreme in beauty and excellence and is responsible for similar qualities in others. […] Love drains us of estrangement and fills us with familiarity, causing us to come together in all shared gatherings like this, and acting as our leader in festival, chorus and sacrifice.  . He is generous of goodwill and ungenerous of ill-will. He is gracious and kindly; gazed on by the wise, admired by the gods; craved by those denied him, treasured by those enjoying him; father of luxury, elegance, delicacy, grace, desire, longing […] For the whole company of gods and humans, most beautiful and best of leaders; every man should follow him singing beautiful hymns of praise, sharing the song he sings to charm the mind of every god and human.`

### Civilizing Force

One of the key elements of Agathon’s speech is his insistence that Love has a civilizing influence on human beings. Love, he claims, "includes mildness and excludes wildness." This suggests that Love tames the baser, more chaotic elements of human nature, replacing them with refinement, harmony, and gentleness. In Agathon’s view, Love is not just about passion or desire; it is also the force that cultivates virtue, civility, and good conduct. The idea that Love excludes "wildness" implies that it is inherently rational and disciplined, aligned with the values of Athenian society, which prized self-control and temperance (sophrosyne).

This view, however, can be seen as an over-simplification of the role of Love in human life. Agathon is eager to place Love in a role that aligns with his artistic and cultural ideals, seeing it as a force that harmonizes society and leads to virtuous behavior. While this may be true to some extent, it ignores the more chaotic, unpredictable, and sometimes destructive aspects of Love, which Plato will explore later in the dialogue through Socrates and Diotima’s account.

### **The Unifying Power of Love**
`Love drains us of estrangement and fills us with familiarity, causing us to come together in all shared gatherings like this, and acting as our leader in festival, chorus and sacrifice.`

Agathon highlights the unifying and communal power of Love, emphasizing how it dissolves feelings of isolation ("estrangement") and replaces them with closeness ("familiarity"). This message reflects a theme of Love as a social force that brings individuals together. In this context, Love is not only about romantic or erotic relationships but also about fostering human connections in all forms. Agathon’s description emphasizes how Love permeates communal life—through gatherings, festivals, and sacrifices—thus serving as a binding agent in society.

By framing Love as a force that eradicates estrangement, Agathon suggests that Love promotes harmony and fellowship among people. It’s not merely an emotion between two individuals but a divine and civilizing power that strengthens societal bonds, creating order and mutual understanding in the public and private spheres.
