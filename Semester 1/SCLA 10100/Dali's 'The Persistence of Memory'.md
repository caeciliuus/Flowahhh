- 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dali, one of the most recognizable surrealist artists
- Born in 1904, though he claims his biography begins 3 months earlier based on pre-natal memories, which he is said to take inspiration from in his pieces
	- Actually makes sense b/c of his use of color
---
- Creative output was self-referential, constantly wrote and thought about himself
	- For many of his works there exists a guide to the work with his own interpretations and impressions (autobiographies)
- Dali was also intimately aware of his own personal history and how his early years affected his adult development and personality, as evidenced by the quotation above. He grandly reinforced this idea on many occasions by describing what he believed were intrauterine memories and sense impressions
- Big fan of Freud, especially his ideas on the dynamic conscious, dream interpretation, formed his own creative process based on this, "paranoid-critical method"
- Dali's childhood was affected by a single fateful and traumatic event which was to dramatically color his entire life.
	- Mom had son 31 months before him, named Salvador for savior, died (parents idealized him, thought he was a genius (interesting considering diary))
	- Parents convinced this was their first son reborn, indulged and spoiled him -> complete reliance on his mom, no independence
		- Grew up thinking he was special, different, better than everyone else
	- Began to know he wasn't loved for himself
	- sometimes believed he was born 2x, "double-self" but b/c his 2x didn't exist, he as a person didn't

>They made comparisons between the two every
>day. They used the same clothes and gave him the
>same toys. They treated him as if he were the
>other one and Dali got the impression that he
>didn't exist

- As a child, Dali was hypersensitive to visual images, "hallucinatory effect"
	- Anti-social, aggressive, narcissistic. Believed he was a genius, dreamt of being immortal
- He was swayed into thinking he was someone else, a boy his parents idealized, but only as an image. The greater self doubt + vulnerability => the more grandiose his presentation became
- **Paranoid-critical method:** "spontaneous method" of irrational knowledge, based on the interpretive critical association of delirious phenomena
	- "It involved setting down an obsessional idea suggested by the unconscious and then elaborating and reinforcing it by a perverse association of ideas and a seemingly irrefutable logic until it took on the conviction of inescapable truth."
	- Dali relied on the wellspring of unformulated, free associations from his unconscious mind to emerge and flow uncensored, whether in dreams, fantasies or during waking life (Gerard, 1968). Then he would freely imagine and produce associations to his original material. He likened this process to the paranoid individual whose vigilant scanning finds persecutory forms in arbitrary visual fields. For him, the original image provided his psyche with a stream of associations that were elaborative as a result of his innate hypersensitivity
	- He took his hallucinatory imagination ad absurdum and approached paranoid states of mind (Shanes, 1991). This enabled the creation of new and fantastic expressions from hypnogogic images
	- Dali did not intend for this process to be passive, but for the individual to actively, critically pursue his vision in a sedulous, methodical manner
	- What separates Dali from the clinically paranoid individual is his ability to remain in control of the process; that is, using his secondary process abilities to control his primary process
	- In essence, Dali used the paranoid-critical process as a method of literally constructing and creating meaning by making sense of his internal world
	- His creative process was an attempt to "systematize confusion" & "contribute to the discredit of the world of reality & undermine tangible perception of the world"
	- The paranoid-critical process thus allows for the transformation of images in relation to an individual's own active perceptual system
- **Dali believed that the reality we see reinforces our willful construction of the world, rather than our vision substantiating the world**
- While considered a surrealist, Dali objected to their automatism & shock as vehicle of expression
	- His religious adherence to his philosophy alienated him from the others. Dali's dedication to his unconscious obsessions were too bold for the movement

"The Persistence of Memory" is one of Spanish artist Salvador Dali's most recognizable oil pieces & serves to explore surrealism, an art style popularized after WWI.

Surrealism (sur=beyond -> "beyond realism") aims to channel the unconscious mind as a means to unlock the power of imagination -> anti-Enlightenment and Freudian ideals, especially psychoanalysis (anti-rationality) and are main tenants of surrealism, concentrated on the belief the rational mind repressed the power of the imagination, weighing it down with taboos
Goal: access the unconscious mind (thoughts/memories/dreams/urges not directed by the conscious mind) to engage in a form of art making unsterilized by social norms or insecurities
Different artists had different methods but many adopted automatism, embracing chance in an attempt to remove consciousness: splattering paint, allowing materials to fall and be placed according to chance

Dali, however, took this a step further with the "paranoid-critical method", alienated him from the rest of the surrealists as they deemed it to be too extreme.  (he was also formally expelled specifically due to his strong support of fascism - moved to America after this)
Relied on the creation of unformulated associations from his unconscious mind to emerge and flow uncensored, whether in dreams, fantasies, waking life. Then he would freely imagine and produce associations to his original material. Active, methodical manner
What separates Dali from the clinically paranoid individual is his ability to remain in control of the process; that is, using his secondary process abilities to control his primary process
Sought to "systemize confusion" and "contribute to the discredit of reality"

Known for being eccentric, big narcisist, considered himself a "genius" , engaged in antics like walking an anteater on a leash in Paris, which sadly served to overshadow the seriousness of his later work
Dali calling himself a genius dates back to his childhood when his parents had a stillborn son before him, also named Salvador (savior). When the Salvador we know was born, his parents were convinced he was their first born son reborn and spoiled him to an extent that severely hurt him. Grew up thinking he was special, different, better than everyone else, parents called him a genius. But came to know that he wasn't loved for himself

As you could probably guess, this painting was created through his "paranoid-critical method"
Despite the fact that the piece seems rooted in the imaginary world, the cliffs in the background have been identified as Dali's hometown
During this time, Dali explored the aesthetics of "soft and hard", which is one of the main three interpretations of the painting, along with science and psychoanalysis
By 1930, Dali found commonground between Freud's psychoanalytic theories and Einstein's relativism, creating a "new" world visualized by the persistence of memory

The limp watch, not suited for marking the passage of time, is in itself a paradox. But  it ceases to be a paradox if, instead of marking time mechanically, it represents the interior perception of time, outside the laws of sensible reality. The soft, fluidity of the clocks demonstrate how the hard concept of time loses its meaning in the unconscious world while the numbers and hands melting into themselves reveal that time isn't reliable and cannot be trusted
In his autobiography, Dali explained that the image of soft watches came to him


The figure with eyelashes, thought to be Dali (due to the moustache), represents his experiences, w/ the strange looking figure often appearing in his hallucinations. The melting clock draped over it shows how the persistence of time will always remain, whether one is in a dream or normal state.

Dali intentionally related the soft watches to the angular rocks to show how he saw reality twofold, claiming both the rational and irrational exist simultaneously. Perhaps this was Dali's visualization of a 'new' world, supported by relativity and Freudianism, through the relationship of the soft forms and hard forms inspired by the coast. The hard is the irrational, impossible to understand, while the soft is the rational as it is the reality experienced every day. 
The rocks, "hard" are unsettling" b/c they appear to conceal something in their simplicity while the soft is unsettling for what it reveals.

In Dali's paintings, he would use ants to show deterioration and decay. This idea is seen in TOPM with the ants crawling over the closed unmelted watch, echoing the eternal passage of time and the understanding that our time on earth is finite and will eventually end, also supported by the dying tree.
 
QUESTION: why the inclusion of his hometown cliffs in a scene of absurdity? 
I THINK it's because Dali, having experienced a childhood of confusion wherein he was loved for somebody he wasn't, was swayed into thinking he was someone else, a boy his parents idealized, but only as an image. It was said in one of his memoirs that as a child, he believed he was born twofold, as a "double-self", but his second self didn't exist, so he as a person didn't exist.
