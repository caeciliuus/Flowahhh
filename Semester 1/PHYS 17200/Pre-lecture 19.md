- Total angular momentum takes into account translational momentum (pt. particle) and rotational momentum (extended sys.)
- Translational angular momentum looks at motion of $x_{cm}$ relative to a reference point
	- Depends on linear momentum of object and position of particle relative to axis, $\vec{r}$ -> $\vec{L}_{tr}=\vec{r}\times \vec{p}$
	- $|\vec{L}_{tr}|=|\vec{r}||\vec{p}|\sin\theta$ (cross product) where $\theta$ is angle between vectors 
	- OR $|\vec{L}_{T}|=|\vec{p}|r_{\perp}$ where $r_{\perp}$ is perpendicular distance from reference point $A$ to $\hat{p}$
- Use right hand rule to determine direction of $|\vec{L}|$ ![[Pasted image 20241105175331.png|300|right]]
	1. The direction of angular velocity and angular momentum are perpendicular to the plane of rotation.
	2. Using the right hand rule, the direction of both angular velocity and angular momentum is defined as the direction in which the thumb of your right hand points when you curl your fingers in the direction of rotation
	3. Torque is perpendicular to the plane formed by r and F and is the direction your right thumb would point if you curled the fingers of your right hand in the direction of F. The direction of the torque is thus the same as that of the angular momentum it produces.
- Rotational angular momentum calculated with the formula $\vec{L}_{r}=I\omega$
- Total $\vec{L}$ of rigid body rotating about axis NOT $x_{cm}:$
$$\vec{L}_{tot}=L_{T,A}+L_{rot}=(m\vec{r}_{cm}\times \vec{v}_{cm})+I_{cm}\vec{\omega}=(m\omega r^2_{cm}\hat{z})+I_{cm}\omega\hat{z}$$
