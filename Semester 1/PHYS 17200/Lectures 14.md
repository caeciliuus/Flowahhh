# Pre-lecture
- Real solids contain atoms interacting w/ each other 
	- Ball and spring model 
	- When 2 atoms are brought close together, they experience a repulsive force; when far away, they experience attractive force
- $U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}ks^2+C$ where C is the reference point 
	- Negative constant implies energy of a spring unstretched can be picked as C ($\frac{1}{2}ks^2-E_{s}$)
	- Negative $U_{s}$ on either side of $s=0$ is consistent w/ notion of 2 atoms in a bound system

- Compressed spring expands: PE decreases, KE increases; *vice versa*
- In a real spring:
	- Wire of spring deforms once it's stretched beyond a point; $U_{s}=0$ b/c spring can't pull further
	- Coils touch each other if compressed beyond a point, $U_{s}\to \infty$ (spring pushes w/ $\infty$ strength)
- For neutral atoms, when $r\to \infty$, $U_{M}=0$ because spring deforms
	- Morse potential function: $U_{M}(r)=E_{M}\Big[1-e^{-\alpha(r-r_{eq})^2}\Big]-E_{M}$
- Energy of a multiparticle system
	- Total constituent internal energy 
	- Potential, rotational, vibrational energies 
- Temperature is a measure of average interval $K+U$ energy (thermal) of a system
	- If atoms vibrate more vigorously, avg $\sum E$ is higher, temp is higher
- If add more temperature to system via surroundings, atoms vibrate more and interatomic distance increases
- Q is energy transfer due to termperature difference between system and surrounding. Causes change in $E_{T}$
- $\Delta E_{T}$, increasing temp of $m$ grams of substabce through temp $\Delta T$, the specific heat $C=\frac{\Delta E_{T}}{m\Delta T}$
- If heat flows from surr -> sys, Q is (+), *vice versa*
- If no heat energy being added/taken from system, $W_{surr}$ changes $E_{internal}$
	- Temp changes accordingly: $\Delta T=\frac{\Delta E_{sys}}{mC}=\frac{W_{ext}}{mC}$
- Power is rate at which work is exerted on a system: $P=\frac{W_{surr}}{\Delta t},W_{surr}=\vec{F}\cdot \Delta \vec{r}, v=\frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}\to \mathbf{P=\vec{F}\cdot \vec{v}}$
- Open systems exchange energy w/ surroundings
	- Energy from surrounding into system results in positive Q, *vice versa*
- Closed systems don't exchange energy w/ surroundings: $E_{in}=E_{out}=0$
- Energy principle: $\Delta E_{sys}=Q+W_{ext}\to\Delta K+\Delta U+\Delta E_{int}=Q+W_{ext}$
- KE on PE curve is equal to the difference between horizontal line $\sum E$ and curve 
# Lecture
- Energy transfer can occur w/ temperature difference in surroundings
	- If thermal energy increases, atoms vibrate w/ more energy
		- Avg. interatomic distance increases, volume increases -> thermal expansion
- Specific heat: amount by which thermal energy of a substance must increase to raise the termperature of 1g by 1$\degree$C
	- Q is energy transfer due to temperature difference between system and surroundings, causes $\Delta E_{T}$
	- Specific heat $C=\frac{\Delta E_{T}}{m\Delta T}$, measured in C 
- If no heat energy is added/removed from a system, work done by surroundings, changes internal energy of ___ (?)
