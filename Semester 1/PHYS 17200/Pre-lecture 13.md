- Change in energy of a system is equal to the work done on it by the surroundings, $\Delta E_{sys}=W_{surr}+Q$ -> cause: $\int _i ^f \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}=\sum^N _{i=1}\vec{F}_{i}\cdot\Delta \vec{r}$ (non-constant)

 - Electric potential energy: due to attraction/repulsion, $U_{elec}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}$
	- Depends on charges $q_{1},q_{2}$ and distance between charges $r$
	- If both charges are positive/negative, you'll have propulsion between the two (positive $U_{e}$)
	- $\mp$ $U_{e}$ is attractive

> Set system as asteroid and spacecraft 
> $$\Delta E_{sys}=\cancel{W_{surr}}$$
> $$\Delta K_{sys}+(\Delta m_{sys})c^2+\Delta U_{sys}=0\to \cancel{\Delta K_{asteroid}}+\Delta K_{spacecraft}+U_{sys}=0 $$
> $$(K_{f}-K_{0})+(U_{f}-U_{i})=0$$

> - When spaceship reaches $r_{3}$, its KE is zero
> 	- Every $r>r_{3}$ e.g $r_{4}$ is 'forbidden' as KE there is < 0

- When are orbits of comets **(1)** closed like planets? **(2)** can escape to infinity
	- One way to tell is to look @ PE curve 
	- When object has negative kinetic energy, it follows the (circular/elliptical) curve below
	- Ellipse becomes bigger and bigger the closer the total energy line gets to the x-axis. Once equal to the x-axis ($\sum E=0$), you get an [unbounded] parabola
	- TL;DR bound state when $K+U<0$, unbound state when $K+U\geq0$
