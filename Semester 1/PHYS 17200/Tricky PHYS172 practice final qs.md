> > PROBLEM 12: A barbell consists of two small balls, each with mass, 𝒎𝒎 at the ends of a very low mass rod of length, 𝒅𝒅. The barbell is mounted on the end of a low-mass rigid rod of length, 𝒃𝒃. This apparatus is started in such a way that while the rod rotates clockwise with angular speed, 𝝎𝝎𝟏𝟏, the barbell rotates clockwise about its center with an speed, 𝝎𝝎 𝟐𝟐. What is the total angular momentum of this system about point B?
