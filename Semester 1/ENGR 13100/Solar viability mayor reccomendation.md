# Instructions
Present a final recommendation to the Mayor, supported with evidence from earlier sections (PC02). Recognize potentially competing or conflicting needs (PS04). Justify decision based on cultural, economic, environmental and other applicable factors recognizing how engineering practice is not only based on technical information but is shaped by cultural, economic, environmental and other factors (EE01). Justify design solution based on how well it meets criteria and constraints for energy, cost, and emissions (SQ02).
# Criteria
- Economically beneficial over time
- Solar panels shouldn't require user input
# Constraints
- 3,600 $m^2$ 
- 24% energy efficiency




With respect to economic viability, the solar panel installation will have a payback time of approximately nine years. The cost of $340,000 is substantial, however the economic benefits of solar installation massively outweigh the high startup fee and slow payback period. These benefits include a cost of energy approximately three times lower ($17,866) than the current cost of energy ($37,607), and a significantly lower quantity of energy to purchase. After the nine year payback period, the library will save between $1200 and $5000 each month.

Looking at the environmental impact of the solar renovation project, there will be a significant decrease in the carbon dioxide emitted from normal library operation. Specifically, the installation of solar panels would significantly decrease the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel electricity generation while keeping the CO2 emitted from natural gas the same. While it would be ideal to decrease both CO2 emissions, fossil fuel produced CO2 makes up the overwhelming majority of the carbon emissions. Furthermore, installing the solar panels at the library would promote the use of clean energy and possibly encourage other Indianapolis buildings to do the same. 

In conclusion, both the environmental and economic analysis of the solar panel installation leads me to recommend the renovation to the library, provided the city has enough money to cover the $340,000 startup cost and considers the nine-year payback period reasonable. If the city doesn't meet either of these conditions, I would recommend waiting until further technological solar innovation decreases the cost of solar energy.
