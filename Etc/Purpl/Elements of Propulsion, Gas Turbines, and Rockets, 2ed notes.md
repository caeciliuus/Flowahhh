> > Jet propulsion systems can be subdivided into two broad categories: airbreathing and non-airbreathing. Airbreathing propulsion systems include the reciprocating, turbojet, turbofan, ramjet, turboprop, and turboshaft engines. Non-airbreathing engines include rocket motors, nuclear propulsion systems, and electric propulsion systems

> > The thrust of a turbojet is developed by compressing air in the inlet and compressor, mixing the air with fuel and burning in the combustor, and expanding the gas stream through the turbine and nozzle. The expansion of gas through the turbine supplies the power to turn the compressor. The net thrust delivered by the engine is the result of converting internal energy to kinetic energy

> > In the turbine section, energy is being removed from the gas stream and converted to shaft power to turn the compressor. The energy is removed by an expansion process that results in a decrease of temperature and pressure. In the nozzle, the gas stream is further expanded to produce a high exit kinetic energy. All the sections of the engine must operate in such a way as to efficiently produce the greatest amount of thrust for a minimum of weight.

> > At speeds approaching the speed of sound, compressibility effects set in and the propeller loses its aerodynamic efficiency. Because of the rotation of the propeller, the propeller tip will approach the speed of sound before the vehicle approaches the speed of sound. This compressibility effect when one approaches the speed of sound limits the design of helicopter rotors and propellers.

> > The ramjet engine consists of an inlet, a combustion zone, and a nozzle. A schematic diagram of a ramjet is shown in Fig. 1.11. The ramjet does not have the compressor and turbine as the turbojet does. Air enters the inlet where it is compressed and then enters the combustion zone where it is mixed with the fuel and burned. The hot gases are then expelled through the nozzle, developing thrust

Turboprop engines are directly connected to the propeller. As a turboprop engine produces thrust, it will simultaneously turn the propeller. Turboshaft engines still turn a propeller, but they aren’t directly connected to a propeller. Instead, turboshaft engines are connected to a gearbox. A transmission sits between turboshaft engines and the propeller. The turboshaft engine will engage the transmission, which will then turn the propeller.

> > Aircraft manufacturers desire engines having low thrust specific fuel consumption S and high specific thrust F//no. Low engine fuel consumption can be directly translated into longer range, increased payload, and/or reduced aircraft size. High specific thrust reduces the cross-sectional area of the engine and has a direct influence on engine weight and installation losses. This desired trend is plotted in Fig. 1.18. Equation (1.23) is also plotted in Fig. 1.18 and shows that fuel consumption and specific thrust are directly proportional.
