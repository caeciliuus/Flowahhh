Beakers and Erlenmeyer flasks are used for holding solutions, mixing reagents, carrying out chemical reactions, or crudely measuring volumes of liquid
Graduated cylinders are designed to measure liquid volumes with moderate accuracy (~0.5%, ~3 significant figures).
The greatest accuracy and precision (Â±0.05%, ~4 significant figures) is obtained with analytical glassware, such as volumetric pipets, burets, and volumetric flasks

| Measuring device         | Uncertainty |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 50 mL graduated cylinder | $\pm.1mL$   |
| 10 mL volumetric pipetx  | $\pm.01mL$  |
| 50 mL buret              | $\pm.01mL$  |
Accuracy is the degree to which the measure is close to the actual value.

percent error$=| \frac{\text{experimental - actual}}{\text{actual}}|(100)$
mean average deviation$=\frac{\sum|x_{i}-\bar{x}}{n}$
volume + density both vary with temperature
molarity$=\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}=\frac{n}{v}$

$m_{1}v_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}$, doesn't apply to reactions, only dilution, 1 = stock, 2 = solution $:)$
percent by mass = $\left( \frac{\text{mass solute}}{\text{mass solution}} \right)(100)$
percent by volume = $\left( \frac{\text{volume of solute}}{\text{volume of solution}} \right)(100)$
molality = $\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilogram of solvent}}$
