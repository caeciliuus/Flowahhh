- Concentration: molarity = $M=$ moles/liter

>[!exm] what is the molarity of a solution that is made up of 5.00g NaOh and 250.0mL of water?
> $$5.00g NaOH| \frac{\text{1 mol }NaOh}{40.0g}|=0.125\text{mol NaOH}$$
> $$\frac{0.125 \text{ mol }NaOH}{0.250L}=0.500M \text{ solution NaOH}$$
- Calculating the mass of solute in solution

> [!exm] Calculate the mass of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ in 10mL of 6M solution
> Calculate the molar mass of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ then calculate the mass of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ in 6.0 M solution
> $$\text{Moles = }\left( 10mL \cdot \frac{1L}{1000mL} \right)(6M)=.06mol$$
$$.06mol \cdot98.0 \frac{g}{mol}=5.88g$$

> [!exm] If you diluted 10.00 mL of 6.0 M $H_{2}SO_{4}$ to prepare 240.0mL solution, what's the concentration of this solution
> $$m_{1}v_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}\to 10(6)=240m\to m=.25g$$

- Percent error (accuracy) = $\frac{|\text{experimental value - theoretical value}|}{\text{theoretical value}}\cdot100$
- Mean absolute deviatation (precision) = $\frac{\sum|x_{i}-\bar{x}|}{n}$
- Sig figs
	- All nonzero digits are significant
	- Zeroes in between nonzero digits are significant
	- Leading zeroes to the left of the nonzero digits are not significant
	- Trailing zeroes that are to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant 
	- If the digit to be dropped is graeter than five, the last retained digit is increased by one
		- $12.6$ is rounded to $13$
	- If the digit  to be dropped is less than 5, the last remaining digit is left as is 
	- 11.5 is rounded to 12 but 12.5 is rounded to 12. If odd, round up; if even, round down
	- For multiplication and division, the answer contains the same number of significant figures as there are in the measurement w/ fewest sig figs
	- For addition and subtraction, the answer has the same number of decimal places as there are in the measruement with the fewest decimal places. $23.54+15.2=38.74$ rounds to 38.7
- Pressure is caused by collisions of atoms/molecules with walls of container
	- SI unit of pressure: Pa (pascal), 1 Pa = 1 $\frac{N}{m^2}$, 1atm = 101,325 Pa
- Boyles Law (effect of pressure on volume, T and $n$ fixed): $V\propto \frac{1}{P}$ 
	- $PV=\text{constant}$
- Charles law (relation between volume and temperature, $P$ and $n$ fixed): $V\propto T$
	- $\frac{V}{T}=\text{constant}$
- Amonton's Law (relation between pressure and temp, V and n fixed): $P\propto T$ 
- combined gas law: $\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}$ in Kelvin
- Avogadro's Law: relation between volume and amount (moles, n)
	- At any fixed temperature and pressure, equal volumes of any ideal gas contains equal numbers of particles
	- 1 mol of any gas at STP occupies $22.4L$ of volume: $V=\text{constant}\times n$
- Ideal gas law: $PV=nRT$
	- P = pressure (atm)
	- V = volume (L)
	- R = universal gas constant, $0.08206(atm L)/(mol K)$
	- n = number of moles

>[!exm] A 0.100g of $Cl_{2}$ is in a 10. mL flask. What's the pressure at $20.0\degree C$
>$$Pv=nRT\to P=\frac{nRT}{V}$$
>$$n=0.100g Cl_{2} \cdot \frac{1mol}{70.9g}=0.00142mol$$
>$$T=20.0+273.15=293.15K$$
>$$V=10.0mL \times \frac{1L}{1000mL}=0.010L$$
>Then solve for $P$

- For a mixture of *unreacting* gasses, the total pressure is the sum of the individual pressures: $\sum P=P_{gas1}+P_{gas2}+\dots$
	- $P_{gas1}= \frac{n_{gas1}RT}{V}\to P_{total}= \frac{n_{gas1}RT}{V}+ \frac{n_{gas2}RT}{V}$

>[!exm] whats the total pressure in a balloon given the following conditions: 0.050 mol $H_{2}$ and 0.025 mol $O_{2}$, balloon = 30.0mL, T=  298 K
>$$P=\frac{nRT}{V}= \frac{(0.050+0.025)mol \cdot0.08206\cdot298K}{0.0300L}=61.1347atm$$

- An acid is a substance that produces $H^+$ ions when dissolved in $H_{2}O$
$$HX\xrightarrow{H_2O}H^+ (aq)+X^- (aq)$$
- A base is a substance that produces $OH^-$ ions when dissolved in $H_{2}O$
$$MOH\xrightarrow{H_{2}O}M^+(aq)+^-OH(aq)$$
- Acid-base reaction is also called a *neutralization* reaction
	- Strong acids and bases react to form $H_{2}O$ and an ionic salt
$$$$
- $H^+$ ion exists as a solvated hydronium ion. $H^+$ does not have an existance by itself. It interacts strongly w/ $H_{2}O$, forming $H_{3}O^+$ in aqueous solution

- Thermochemistry: study of quantity of heat absorbed or evolved by chemical changes (chemical reactions)
	- Thermodynamics is the science of the relationship between heat and other forms of energy
- Waves of energy have oscillating electric and magnetic fields, hence called electromagnetic
	- Lower wavelength is blue - UV, while higher wavelength is red - IR
- Kinetic energy: energy of motion, $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- Potential energy: stored energy
- Energy is stored in molecules and some molecules store more energy than others, depending on the bonds
	- When fuel is burned, PE is converted to KE. Amount of KE you can get out depends on amount of PE available: $\pm PE=\mp KE$
$$2C_{8}H_{18}+25O_{2}\to16CO_{2}+18H_{2}O+energy$$
	- system is what we are studying while the surroundings are everything else
- Internal energy of a system is sum of all P/KE components
	- Internal energy changes $\Delta E$ when reactants change to products.
	- If energy is lost from the system to the surroundings, $\Delta E<0$
	- $\Delta E=E_{products}-E_{reactants}$
- Work (w) is energy transferred when an object is moved against a force
	- Work done on system $w>0$; work done by system $w<0$
	- $w=F\times d=kg\cdot \frac{m^2}{s^2}$
	- Work done when system V changes in the presence of external P: $w=-P\Delta V$ where P is pressure applied (40:48)
- Heat (q) is energy transferred from hotter -> colder object, $\Delta E=q+w$
- Calorie (cal): quantity of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 celsius. 1 cal  = 4.184J

>[!exm] What's $\Delta E$ of a system that releases 675 J of thermal energy to its surroundings and has 530 J of work on it 
> $$\Delta E=q+w=(-675+530)=-145J$$

- Value of a state function depends on the state of the system, not how we arrived at that state
	- Internal energy is a state function, meaning it depends on the initial and final state. q and w are not state functions, they depend on the path followed during a change
$C_{3}H_{8}+5O_{2}\to3CO_{2}+4H_{2}O$: products have 6 mol and reactants have 7 mol meaning $\Delta V=\pm$ so work is negative, done by the system

>[!exm] a reaction taking place in a container w/ a piston-cylinder assembly at constant temp produces a gas and the volume increases from 125 -> 652 mL against an external pressure of 988 torr. Calculate work in J (1 $atm\cdot L=101.3J$)
>(1) convert P to atm (2) convert $\Delta V$ to L (3) use the equation 1 $atm\cdot L$=101.3J to convert to units of work
> $$P=988torr=1.30atm,\Delta V=(652-125)mL=.527L$$
> $$w(atm\cdot L)=-(1.30atm\cdot.527L)=-0.685atm\cdot L\to w(J)=-0.685atm\cdot L \times \frac{101.3J}{1atm\cdot L}=-69.4J$$

- At constant pressure, most reactions involve little PV work and change in enthalpy if the heat is released or absorbed: $H = E+PV\to q_{p}=\Delta E+P\Delta V=\Delta H$
	- For most reactions $\Delta H\approx\Delta E$
	- $\Delta H_{reactions}= H_{products}-H_{reactants}$
- Enthalpy represents the heat energy "tied up" in chemical bonds. It is a state function. Can be used to obtain the heat absorbed or evolved in a chemical reaction
