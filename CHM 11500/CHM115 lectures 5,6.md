- Enthalpy is an extensive quantity, meaning it depends on the quantity of substance
	- Sign of $\Delta H$ indicates whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Negative -> exothermic; positive -> endothermic
- Reactions such as precipitation, acid-base, redox, do not produce gases. Since change in volumes of liquids and solids are quite small: $\Delta V=0,\Delta H=\Delta E$
- Reactions in which the amount (mol) of gas does not change: $\Delta V=0,\Delta H=\Delta E$
- Reactions in which amount (mol) of gas does change: $q_{p}\gg P\Delta V$
- When a compound is produced from its elements, the enthalpy change is called *heat of formation* $\Delta H_{f}$
	- $K(s)+\frac{1}{2}Br_{2}(l)\to KBr(s) ~~~\Delta H=\Delta H_{f}$
- When a substance melts, the enthalpy change is called *heat of fusion*
	- $NaCl(s)\to NaCl(l)~~~~\Delta H=\Delta H_{fus}$
- When a substance vaporizes, the enthalpy change is called *hat of vaporization*
	- $C_{6}H_{6}(l)\to C_{6}H_{6}(g)~~~~\Delta H=\Delta H_{vap}$
- When a substance sublimes, the enthalpy change is called *heat of sublimation*
	- $Na(s)\to Na(g)~~~~\Delta H=\Delta H_{sub}$
- Heat of reactions is determined by the measuring of heat liberated (exothermic) or absorbed during the reaction
	- Heat required to change the temperature of 1g of a substance by 1K is its heat capacity (C)
		- specific heat capacity (c) = $\frac{q}{\text{mass}\times\Delta T}$
- A thermochemical equation is a balanced equation that includes $\Delta H_{rxn}$. When a chemical equation is reversed, the sign of $\Delta H$ is also reversed 
$$N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)\to2NH_{3}(g)~~~~\Delta H_{rxn}=-91.8J$$
- For chemical equation written as the sum of 2 or more steps, $\Delta H$ for the overall equation is the sum of enthalpy changes for the individual steps
	- It is often necessary to reverse chemical equations to couple them so that chemical species are on the right side of the equation. May be necessary to multiply through by a coefficient to cancel common species
- Steps for calculating $\Delta H$ for an overall process
	1. Identify target equation, the step whose $\Delta H$ is unknown
	2. Note amount of each product + reactant
	3. Manipulate each equation with known $\Delta H$ values so that target amount of each substance is on the correct side of the equation
		- change sign of $\Delta H$ when you reverse, multiply amount (mol) and $\Delta H$ by same factor
	4. Add manipulated equations and their resulting $\Delta H$ values to get the target equation and its $\Delta H$

>[!exm] Calculate $\Delta H$ for an overall process $CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\to CO_2(g)+2H_{2}O(l)$
> $$\text{given 1: }CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g)+2H_{2}O(g)~~\Delta H=-802kJ$$
> $$\text{given 2: }H_{2}O(l)\to H_{2}O(g)~~\Delta H=44kJ$$
> $$CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g)+\cancel{ 2H_{2}O(g) }~~\Delta H=-802kJ$$
> $$\cancel{ 2H_{2}O(g) }\to2H_{2}O(l)=-88kJ$$
> $$\Delta H=[-802+(-88)]=-890kJ$$

- Standard state: standard thermodynamic conditions (1 atm and 25$\degree$C) chosen for substances when listing or comparing thermodynamic data. Enthalpy change for reaction in which  reactants are in their standard states is denoted as "standard hat of reaction" $\Delta H^{\degree}_{rxn}$
	- $\Delta H^{\degree}_{formation}$ is enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a substance in its standard state from its component elements in standard states. $\Delta H^{\degree}_{formation}$ for a "pure element" in its standard state is zero (0)
- Enthalpy of a reaction, standard heat of reaction is equal to total sum of formation energy of products minus that of that of reactants: $\Delta H_{rxn}=\sum m\Delta H^{\degree}_{f,reac}-\sum n\Delta hH^{\degree}_{f,prod}$

>[!exm] Calculate $H^{\degree}_{rxn}$ for the following reaction after it is balanced $C_{3}H_{8}(g)+5O_{2}(g)\to 3CO_{2}(g)+4H_{2}O(g)$
>Given:
> - $H^{\degree}_{f}(C_{3}H_{8}(g))=-104.7kJ/mol$
> - $H^{\degree}_{f}(CO_{2}(g))=-393.5kJ/mol$
> - $H^{\degree}_{f}(H_{2}O)=-241.826kJ/mol$
> $$(-104.7+0)\to3(393.5)+4(-241.826)=\Delta H_{rxn}=-2147.8-(-104.7)=2043.1kJ/mol$$
- Structure of the neutral atom
	- Mostly empty space, outer negative electrons
	- Nucleus contains positive protons and neutrons, all of the mass of the atom
	- Density: $10^{14} \frac{g}{ml}$
	- Isotopes have different numbers of neutrons
- $^A _Z \text{Symbol}$ where A is atomic number, Z is atomic number
	- Subatomic particles: protons, electrons, neutrons
	- Number of protons = number of electrons
- Nucleon: number of proton + neutron
- Nuclide: "species of nucleus" w/ a specific mass number, chlorine-35
- Strong force (nuclear binding energy): attractive force that keeps the nucleus together, overwhelming the repulsive electrostatic force
- Relative mass and charge of a particle described by notation $_{Z}^A x$ where A is mass number and Z is charge of particle
	- electron: $^0 _{-1}e$

- Beta particle, negatron, $_{-1}^0 \beta$ is a high speed electron. Difference between them is beta particle is from nucleus, electron is in outer orbit
- Beta particle, positron $^0 _1 \beta$ is a positively charged electron
