### Ionization Energy (IE)
![[CHM115 lecture 11, 12#^b4d6d6]]
- Sublimation energy not included in transition from (s) -> (g) in ionization energy
	- Supply more and more energy to remove $e^-$, endothermic
	- Energy flows into system, endothermic $\therefore\Delta H$ is (+)
- There are as many IEs as there are $e^-$. Subsequent IEs are higher than first b/c you're removing negative charge from increasingly positive ion: $IE_{3}>IE_{2}>IE_{1}$
- IE decreases down a group and increases across a period because electrons are further apart / atom size increases
- Atoms with lower IE tend to form cations during reactions. Atoms w/ higher IE tend to form anions
- Boron has less IE than Be b/c it's easier to remove one p- $e^-$ from B than the 2nd s- $e^-$ of Be

- Large jump in IE value occurs at different places depending on group. Group 1 has large jump at $IE_{1}\to IE_{2}$, group 3 has large jump at $IE_{3}\to IE_{4}$
	- Takes significantly more IE to remove a core $e^-$, thus the jumps in IE
- For ionization of d-block elements, "first in -> first out"
	- Ti: [Ar]$4s^23d^2$; $e^-$ config for $Ti^{2+}$ is [Ar]$3d^2$; $e^-$ config for $Ti^{2-}$ is [Ar]$4s^23d^4$
- This rule only applies for non d-block elements. Sn is [Kr]$5s^24d^{10}5p^2$ while $Sn^{2+}$ is [Kr]$5s^24d^{10}$. $Sn^{4+}$ is [Kr]$4d^{10}$ so that the shell is filled
### Electron Affinity (EA)
- **Electron Affinity:** change in E (kJ/mol) accompanying the addition of 1 mol $e^-$ to 1 mol gaseous atoms/ions. Energy may be absorbed or released: $X(g)+e^-\to X^-(g)$
- The larger the atom affinity for an $e^-$, the more (-) the EA value is
	- Decreases down a column and increases across periods
- In most cases, $EA_{1}$ is (-) but $EA_{2}$ is always (+) because energy must be absorbed to overcome electrostatic repulsions and add another electron to an anion
- EA: C = -122 kJ/mol, N = 7 kJ/mol, O = -141kJ/mol
	- Because C wants one more electron to fill its valence shell $\uparrow\uparrow \_\_$. N has $\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow$ so it doesn't need an $e^-$
- Cl has highest EA becuase it has a lot of $e^-$ orbital space available
### Ionic Size, Magnetic Behavior
- Cation size decreases as charge increases; **Ionic size** (magnitude) increases as you go further down groups
- **Isoelectronic series:** collection of ions with same electron configuration. Within the series, ion size decreases as $z_{eff}$ increases. 



- A spinning electron generates a tiny magnetic field and is influenced by an external applied magnetic field
- A beam of Se atoms is split by an external magnetic field but a Zn beam isn't because Zn is a diamagnetic element, only contains paired $e^-$. Se however has more than one orbital with unpaired $e^-$ $\therefore$ it's weakly attracted to the magnetic field - Zn not attracted at all

### Non/Metallic Behavior
- All atoms are metals or nonmetals except for a small group, "metalloids", separating non/metals on the periodic table. H is a nonmetal
	- Metals must be solid & shiny, excluding mercury
- Metals form cations while nonmetals form anions
- Metallic behavior increases down a group and decreases across a period
- Oxidation is loss of $e^-$, reduction is $e^-$ gain
- Metals are reducing agents, lose $e^-$, nonmetals are oxidizing agents
- Usually all atoms in the same group form ions w/ the same charge
	- Main group metals form "ionic oxides", basic in aqueous solutions (produces $OH^-$)
	- Main group nonmetals form "covalent oxides", acidic in aqueous solutions (produces $H^+$)
- Oxides: molecules with $O^{2-}$
- Oxides become more basic down a group and more acidic across a period 
### Bonding
![[Pasted image 20250308180054.png|center]]
- Chemical bond: force holding 2 atoms together
	- **Metallic bonds**: metal + metal
		- Conductive electrons are distributed over many atomic nuclei
	- **Ionic bonds**: nonmetal + metal
		- Electrons are "donated" to non-metal, complete transfer of $e^-$
	- **Covalent bonds**: nonmetal + nonmetal
		- Atoms share $e^-$ pairs
- **Lewis dot diagrams** show valence in nuclei
	- \# dots = \# outer (valence) $e^-$. Leave maximum number of unpaired $e^-$
	- Metals: \# dots = \# $e^-$ it loses to form cations
	- Non metals: \# unpaired dots = \# $e^-$ gained or shared
- Most atoms possess filled outer shells when bonded
- Transferring electrons creates closed shells in ionic compounds
### Enthalpy change, lattice energy
- **Standard Enthalpy of Formation**: $\Delta H$ for all formation of 1 mol of a substance in its standard state form from its component elements in standard states
	- $\Delta H_{f}^0=0$ for 'pure elements' ($C,H_{2},O_{2}$)
- Energy released (exo) when bonds formed, energy absorbed (endo) when bonds break
- When compound is created from its elements, enthalpy change is heat of reaction $\Delta H_{f}$
- When a substance melts/vaporizes/sublimes, $\Delta H$ is called Heat of Fusion/Vaporization/Sublimation
$$\Delta H_{rxn}^0=\sum m\Delta H_{f ~(prod)}^0-\sum m\Delta H_{f~(reac)}^0$$
- **Lattice energy**: energy required (endothermic) to separate a mole of an ionic solid into gaseous ions or energy released (exo) when mol of gaseous ions -> ionic solid
	- Magnitude of lattice energy depends on charge and radius
