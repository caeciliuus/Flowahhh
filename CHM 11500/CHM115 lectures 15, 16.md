- Lattice energy cannot be measured directly but can be estimated w/ a Born-Haber cycle
$$NaCl(s)\to Na^+(g)+Cl^-(g)\pm\Delta H$$
$$Na^+(g)+Cl^-(g)\to NaCl(s)\mp\Delta H$$
- $\Delta H_{f}$ for LiF can be derived from 5 possible reactions:
	1. Li sublimation: $Li(s)\to Li(g),\pm\Delta H$
	2. Li ionization: $Li(g)\to Li^+(g)+e^-,\pm\Delta H$
	3. Fl atomization: $F_{2}(g)\to2F(g),\pm\Delta H$
	4. Fl $e^-$ affinity: $F(g)+e^-\to F^-(g),\mp\Delta H$
	5. Lattice energy: $Li^+(g)+F^-(g)\to LiF(s),\Delta H=$ lattice energy, $\mp$
- Lattice energy / $\Delta H_{f}$ anomaly for group 2 metal oxides
- Coulomb's Law: $E_{attraction}= \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}$ where $q_{n}$ are respective charges and $r$ is internuclear distance
- Latice energy decreases as ionic radius increases
- Bond energy: energy required to overcome the electrostatic attraction of a bond and separate its components into isolated atoms. Occurs at PE x Ionic Radius graph equilibrium
- Band dissociation energy $D_{x-y}$ for a diatomic molecule is $\Delta H_{rxn}$
$$XY(g)\to X(g)+Y(g),D_{x-y}=\Delta H^0$$
- The shorter the bond, the higher the bond energy
- Sometimes pairs of atoms can gain greater energy advantage by sharing > 1 electron pair
- Bond order: number of pairs of $e^-$ shared between two atoms
	- Bond energy increases w/ bond order
- In molecules w/ 2+ bonds, sum of all bond energies is the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction that breaks all bonds in the molecule
