$$A=\epsilon bc$$
- A: absorbance of light
- $\epsilon$: molar absorptivity (light absorbed per molar concentration per centimeter)
- b: distance light needs to travel through the substance (path length, measured in CM, typically the same as cuvette length)
- c: concentration ($M$)
- Standard curve: absorbance vs concentration
	- Measure absorbance for multiple known concentrations 
	- Slope of the line $m=\epsilon b$ (when b = 1.0cm)
	- Can use slope to predict absorptivity
	- Y-int should be zero but don't force it to zero

> What is the concentration of Fe2+, in M, in a standard solution prepared by diluting 4.00 mL of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution that has a concentration of 2.50 x 10-4 to a total volume of 25.00 mL with deionized water?
