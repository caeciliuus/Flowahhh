1. Partner #1 rubs the surface of a piece of aluminum to remove the shiny coating of oxide then wipes it with a KimWipe to remove dust. Then partner #1 cuts the aluminum into small pieces and weighs out 0.5g +- 0.001g. Meanwhile, partner #2 sets up a hot plate (heat 3) under a snorkel hood  and places the aluminum into a 100mL beaker to go on top of the hot plate. Then partner #2 adds 20mL of 2 M KOH with a graduated cylinder. The solution heats up until all the solid aluminum dissolves, ~10-15 minutes. If the volume drops below 10mL, add DI to bring the volume to 10mL
2. Partner #1 heats 10mL DI in a 100mL beaker on a hotplate, setting 3, for ~5 minutes. While the water is heating up, partners will set up a gravity filtration aparatus identical to the attached image. Make sure that a small piece of glass wool at the bottom of the funnel to remove the impurities from the solution. 
3. Using an oven mitt, Partner #1 picks up the hot 100mL aluminum mixture and pours it through the funnel. Partner #2 runs the filtrate through the wool again into another clean beaker if any solids remain in the filtrate.
4. Partner #1 adds 10mL of the hot DI via a disposable dropper into the filtration system to collect remaining reaction solution into the filtrate. Solution may be grey/light brown. Partner #2 records observations and considers the chemical changes that occurred 
5. After allowing the solution to cool, Partner #1 slowly stirs in 10mL of 9 M H2SO4, 1mL at a time then adds the solution to the hot plate, setting 3 for 5-10 minutes until the solution is clear. Partner #2 uses pH paper to check if the solution is below 3. If the solution isn't clear, partner #1 filters it through the glass wool as before
6. Partner #2 fills two 600mL beaker halfway with ice then pours 20mL of 50% ethanol into a clean 250mL beaker to be cooled in one of the 600mL beakers. The ethanol will be used in the vaccum filtration. The solution volume > 25 mL so partner #1 heats the volution until its volume has reduced to ~25mL, making sure that the solution does not boil
7. Once the volume ~25mL, partner #2 picks up the beaker and places it in the other 600mL iced beaker for 10-15 minutes, occasionally stirring gently, until white crystals appear. While partner #2 keeps an eye on the beaker, partner #1 sets up the vacuum filtration system (see image) and places a filter paper circle on the bottom of the Buchner funnel.
8. Once the solution has crystalized, partner #1 wets the filter paper with DI and calls Sofia over to turn on the vacuum. Now partner #2 pours the solution onto the filter paper while swirling the beaker. 
9. Partner #1 then rinses the beaker with 5mL of cold ethanol and transfers them onto filter paper before Partner #2 washes the crystals on the paper with the cold ethanol. After 10-15 minutes, partner #1 scrape the crystals from the filter paper into a pre-weighed 100mL beaker and records the mass.
10. Afterwards, the partners put 1-2g of the product into a scintillans vial labeled "Alum" followed by their initials to be stored in their equipment drawer
