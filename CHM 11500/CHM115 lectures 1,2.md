- number of protons is constant throughout a specific element but number of electrons (creating an ion) and number of neutrons (isotope) can vary.
	- Isotope notation: $_{p^+}^{p^+ + n^0}X$
	- Element notation: $X^{p^+} _{p^+ +n^0}$
- Atoms are neutral when the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons
- Electron removed from neutral atom results in positive ion [cation] (more protons than electrons)
- Electron added to neutral atom results in negative ion [anion] (more electrons than protons)
- Charge of an element is the difference between the number of protons and number of electrons
- Group 1 of the periodic table have a $+1$ charge, group 2 has $+2$ charge, group 7 has $+1$ charge 
	- Species in a period (row) may have the same number of electrons, called isoelectronic 
- **Example**: how many total electrons are in a Cu ion with a $+2$ charge?
	- Cu has 29 protons $\therefore$ for Cu to have a $+2$ charge, there must be 27 electrons.
- **Sig fig rules**
	- Non-zero digits are always significant
	- Leading zeroes are never significant
	- Trailing zeroes are significant if a decimal point is shown in the number
	- Zeroes between nonzero digits are always significant
- **Laws of Mass Conservation**
	- Atoms cannot be created or destroyed: $\sum \text{(reactant mass)}=\sum \text{(product mass)}$
	- In chemical reactions, atoms of one element cannot be converted into atoms of another element
- **Example**: if you burn 24.6g of hydrogen and produce 2.2E2 g of water, how much oxygen reacted?
	- $24.6H+xO=2.2E2 H_{2}O\to m_{oxygen}=2.2E2 -24.6=195g$
- Atomic mass number refers to number of $p^+$ and $n^0$ in an atom
- Molecular mass refers to avg. mass of a molecule
	- Molecular mass of $H_{2}O=2(1.008\text{g/mol})+16.00\text{g/mol}=18.02\text{g/mol}$
- Molar mass refers to the mass per mole of substance
	- 1 mol oxygen, O, atoms = 16.00g

- **Example:** For the chemical reaction $3KOH+H_{3}PO_{4}\to K_{3}PO_{4}+3H_{2}O$, how many moles of potassium phosphate will be produced from 41.6g of potassium hydroxide?
	1. Convert $41.6g$ KOH to mol KOH
	$$1\text{ mol KOH}=56.105g\to41.6g\text{ KOH} \cdot\left( \frac{1\text{ mol KOH}}{56.105g} \right)=.741\text{ mol KOH}$$
	2. Convert to mol K3PO4
		$$.741\text{ mol KOH}\cdot \frac{\text{1 mol }K_{3}PO_{4}}{\text{3 mol KOH}}=.247\text{ mol }K_{3}PO_{4}$$
- **Example**: how many g of Br are in 285g $CaBR_{2}$ (hint: $g\to mol\to g$)?
$$\text{1 mol }CaBr_{2}: 40.08+2(79.9)=199.9g \text{ }CaBr_{2}$$
$$285g ~ \cancel{ CaBr_{2} } \cdot\left( \frac{158.8g ~Br}{199.9g~\cancel{ CaBr_{2} }} \right)=226g ~ Br$$
- **Example:** how many atoms are in 3.3 mol of ammonium sulfide $(NH_{4})_{2}S$
	1. Use Avogadro's # to find formula units $(NH_{4})_{2}S$
$$3.3\text{mol} ~(NH_{4})_{2}S\cdot\left( \frac{6.022E23}{1\text{mol}} \right)=1.99E24\text{ units}$$
	1. After determining number of H atoms per formula unit (=8), determine how many H atoms are in 3.3mol $(NH_{4})_{2}S$.
$$1.99E24\text{ units }(NH_{4})_{2}S\cdot \frac{8\text{ H-atoms}}{\text{1 unit }(NH_{4})_{2}S}=1.59E25\text{ H atoms}$$
- **Balancing chemical equations** 
	1. Write the correct formula for the reactants and products. Write correct formulas first. Most importantly, once you write them correctly DO NOT change the formulas
	2. Find the number of atoms for each element on the left side. Compare those against # atoms of the same element on the right side
	3. Determine where to place coefficients in front of formulas so that the left side has the same number of atoms as the right side for each element 
	4. Check answer to see if number of atoms on both sides of the equation are now balanced. Balance before converting g $\leftrightarrow$ mol
- Waves of energy have oscillating electric and magnetic fields, hence called electromagnetic
	- Lower wavelength is blue - UV, while higher wavelength is red - IR
- Kinetic energy: energy of motion, $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- Potential energy: stored energy
- Energy is stored in molecules and some molecules store more energy than others, depending on the bonds
	- When fuel is burned, PE is converted to KE. Amount of KE you can get out depends on amount of PE available: $\pm PE=\mp KE$
$$2C_{8}H_{18}+25O_{2}\to16CO_{2}+18H_{2}O+energy$$
	- system is what we are studying while the surroundings are everything else
- Internal energy of a system is sum of all P/KE components
	- Internal energy changes $\Delta E$ when reactants change to products.
	- If energy is lost from the system to the surroundings, $\Delta E<0$
	- $\Delta E=E_{products}-E_{reactants}$
- Work (w) is energy transferred when an object is moved against a force
	- Work done on system $w>0$; work done by system $w<0$
	- $w=F\times d=kg\cdot \frac{m^2}{s^2}$
	- Work done when system V changes in the presence of external P: $w=-P\Delta V$ where P is pressure applied (40:48)
- Heat (q) is energy transferred from hotter -> colder object, $\Delta E=q+w$
- Calorie (cal): quantity of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 celsius. 1 cal  = 4.184J

>[!exm] What's $\Delta E$ of a system that releases 675 J of thermal energy to its surroundings and has 530 J of work on it 
> $$\Delta E=q+w=(-675+530)=-145J$$

- Value of a state function depends on the state of the system, not how we arrived at that state
	- Internal energy is a state function, meaning it depends on the initial and final state. q and w are not state functions, they depend on the path followed during a change
$C_{3}H_{8}+5O_{2}\to3CO_{2}+4H_{2}O$: products have 6 mol and reactants have 7 mol meaning $\Delta V=\pm$ so work is negative, done by the system

>[!exm] a reaction taking place in a container w/ a piston-cylinder assembly at constant temp produces a gas and the volume increases from 125 -> 652 mL against an external pressure of 988 torr. Calculate work in J (1 $atm\cdot L=101.3J$)
>(1) convert P to atm (2) convert $\Delta V$ to L (3) use the equation 1 $atm\cdot L$=101.3J to convert to units of work
> $$P=988torr=1.30atm,\Delta V=(652-125)mL=.527L$$
> $$w(atm\cdot L)=-(1.30atm\cdot.527L)=-0.685atm\cdot L\to w(J)=-0.685atm\cdot L \times \frac{101.3J}{1atm\cdot L}=-69.4J$$

- At constant pressure, most reactions involve little PV work and change in enthalpy if the heat is released or absorbed: $H = E+PV\to q_{p}=\Delta E+P\Delta V=\Delta H$
	- For most reactions $\Delta H\approx\Delta E$
	- $\Delta H_{reactions}= H_{products}-H_{reactants}$
- Enthalpy represents the heat energy "tied up" in chemical bonds. It is a state function. Can be used to obtain the heat absorbed or evolved in a chemical reaction
