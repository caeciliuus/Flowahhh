- Electron energy $E\propto \psi$, spatial distribution $\propto \psi^2$
- SchrÃ¶dinger wave equation coordinates: principal ($n$), angular momentum ($\ell$), magnetic ($m_{1}$)
	- [respectively] Describes the size, shape, and orientation in space of atomic orbitals
	- Spin $m_{s}$ refers to spin orientation of 2 electrons that occupy an atomic orbital (CCW/CW)
		- Spin denoted with $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$
- **Principal quantum number** $n$ can have any positive values from $1-7$
	- Represents relative size of the orbital and shell number in which an electron resides
	- Describes period number of periodic table
	- Smaller the $n$, the smaller the orbital and lower the electron energy
- Each row called a period, each column called a group
	- Elements in each period have the same number of shells
- **Angular momentum** $\ell$ describes "subshells" within a given shell - can be any integer from $0$ to $n-1$
	- Different $\ell$ values, $0,1,2,3,\dots$ correspond to letters $s,p,d,f$ used in electron configuration
- **Magnetic quantum number** $m_{\ell}$ defines atomic orbitals within a sub shell
	- For a given value of $\ell,m_{\ell}$ can have any integer value from $-\ell$ to $\ell$
	- Each value of $\ell$ determines the number of atomic orbitals of the same energy
- **Spin quantum number** $m_{s}$ refers to the possible spin orientations of the electrons residing within a given orbital
	- Each atomic orbital can hold only 2 electrons w/ opposite spin orientations
	- Possible values of $m_{s}$ are $+ \frac{1}{2}\uparrow$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\downarrow$
- "s orbitals": spherical, existing for values $n\geq1$
- **Aufbau Principal:** atom is "built up" by progressively adding electrons in an order that corresponds to increasing energy
- **Pauli Exclusion Principal:** impossible for  two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values for quantum numbers. For 2 electrons in the same orbital, $m,\ell,m_{\ell}$ are the same so $m_{s}$ must be opposite
- **Hund's Rule of Multiplicity:** every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any other orbital is doubly occupied & all electrons in a singly occupied orbitals have the same spin
- Filling mnemonic device:
	- $n$ constant horizontally
	- $\ell$ constant vertically
	- $n+\ell$ are constantly diagonally
- Na has 11 electrons: $1s^22s^22p^63s^1\to[Ne]3s^1$

- Period 4 anomalies
	- Cr is half filled
	- Cu is weird $\uparrow|\uparrow \downarrow ~ \uparrow \downarrow ~\uparrow\downarrow~\uparrow\downarrow ~ \uparrow|$ [Ar] $4s^13d^{10}$
- Cr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Au also anomalies
- Pb config is [Xe]$6s^24f^{14}5d^{10}6p^2$
	- $Pb^{4+}$ is pseudo-noble gas configuration
- Types of electrons
	- Outer electrons: those in highest energy level
	- Core electrons: those which atom has in common w noble gasses and completed transition series
	- **Valence electrons**: those involved in forming bonds, organized by group
		- In main group, valence = outer; in transition metals, valence = outer + x # number of d electrons
		- Selenium has 6 valence electrons because [Ar]$4s^23d^{10}4p^4$ -> $4s^2$ and $4p^4$ are highest energy level

- As you go downwards, size - atomic radius - increases, determined by distances between radii
	- Controlling factors
		1. Principal quantum number
		2. Effective nuclear charge
- **Effective nuclear charge**: charge that each electron experiences
	- Greater nuclear charge lowers sublevel energy to a more negative energy, making electron harder to remove
- As $n$ and $z_{{eff}}$ decrease, atomic radii (pm) increase. Certain atoms like Ga are anomalies
- Transition metals decrease then increase L -> R b/c $z_{eff}$ decreases then increases, 'shielding effect'
- **Ionization energy**: minimum energy required for the complete removal of 1 mol of electrons from 1 mol of gaseous atoms/ions: $X(g)\to X^+(g)+e^-$ ^b4d6d6
