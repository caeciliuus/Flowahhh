- **Planck radiation law**: $E=hv=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$ where 
	- $E$ = photon energy
	- $h$ = Planck's constant
	- $v$ = frequency: number of cycles wave under goes per second, $hz$
	- $\lambda$ = wavelength: distance between two peaks
	- $c=\lambda \cdot v$ = speed of light ($\frac{m}{s}$)

- Electrons around nucleus have low energy, vice versa for orbiting electrons. When an electron moves from higher -> lower energy level, a photon is released. A photon is absorbed if moved from lower -> higher 
- Wavelength $\lambda$ and frequency $v$ are inversely proportional

- The waves of energy have oscillating electric and magnetic fields, radiation is called electromagnetic. No clear distinction between types of light, they're fluid

- H atom has only certain allowable energy levels
	- Atoms doesn't radiate energy while it's in a stationary state
	- When an electron changes energy level, it gains/loses energy as electromagnetic radiation
- **Rydberg equation** predicts positions and wavelengths of the lines in a series: $\frac{1}{\lambda}=R\left( \frac{1}{n^2_{1}}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^2} \right)$
	- R = Rydberg constant = 1.097373E7
- **Bohr equation** provides an explanation for the creation of a spectral line. Uses "Bohr orbits" to describe the physical motion and position of a one electron system such as the hydrogen atom
	- Energy levels $\Delta E$ of the H atom are described by the Bohr equation, negative sign shows that energy is released
	- $\Delta E=E_{final}-E_{init}=-2.18E-18J\left( \frac{1}{n^2_{final}}-\frac{1}{n_{init}^2} \right)$

>[!exm] A laser pointer emits at 650nm. What is its frequency and photon energy? ($h=6.626E-34J\cdot s,c=2.99782E8m/s$)
>Convert nm -> m: $650nm=6.5E-7m$
> $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}= \frac{3E8(6.626E-34)}{6.5E-7}$$

- Red diffracts/bends light the least, violet diffracts the most
$$v=\frac{c}{\lambda},E=hv=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
- Color temperature is related to the temperature of a hot glowing black body radiation
	- Higher the tmperature -> lower the wavelength
- electrons in metals exist in different and specific energy states
	- Photons whose frequency matches or exceeds the energy state of the electron will be absorbed 
	- After absorbing energy, the electron moves to a higher energy state and is ejected from the metal surface
	- Light spectrum for each element is unique
$$\text{Rydberg Equation: } \frac{1}{\lambda}=R\left( \frac{1}{n_{1}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^2} \right) ~(n_{2}>n_{1})$$
- Different molecules can absorb light of different colors (energties)
	- Beer-Lambert Law: $A=\ln\left( \frac{I_{0}}{I} \right)=\varepsilon \ell c$
		- $I_{0}$: intensity of radiation entering sample
		- $I$: intensity of radiation exiting sample
		- $\varepsilon:$ molar absorptivity
		- $c$: concentration (M)
		- $\ell$: path length
- Bohr Model: negatively charged electrons surround positively charged nucleus in stationary orbits
	- Visible series: $n_{1}=2$
	- Ultraviolet series: $n_{1}=1$
	- Infrared series: $n_{1}=3$
- H atom has only certain allowable energy levels, "stationary states"
	- Atom releases more energy when an electron moves from $n$ = 1 -> $n$ = 2 than $n$ = 2 -> $n$ = 3
- Wave function $\psi$ has no direct meaning, $\psi^2$ is probability density, measure of how likely an electron can be found in a volume of an atom
