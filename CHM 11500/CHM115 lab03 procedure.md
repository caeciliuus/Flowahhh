*Note: steps 1 - 12 must be done under a snorkel hood due to remove gaseous chemicals from the reaction*
1. **Partner #1** adds 150mL $H_{2}O$ water to a 250mL beaker then places it on the hot plate, setting 3, while **partner #2** pours 15mL $H_2O$ into a 6" test tube then places the test tube in the beaker (still on the hot plate). Then one partner labels a vial with both partner's initials.
2. **Partner #1** adds 1.5 spatulas of 3-nitrophthalic acid ($C_{8}H_{8}NO_{6}$) to the vial as well as 40 drops of 8% aqueous solution to the vial and two boiling chips (tiny rocks that prevent the "sudden splashing of liquids or gasses out of your reaction flask"). While **Partner #1** is doing this, **Partner #2** places an aluminum heating block on top of the second hot plate, where the vial will be placed when **Partner #1** is finished.
3. Once the liquid dissolves, **Partner #1** removes the [held sideways] vial from the hotplate using oven mitts to be placed on a heat resistant pad (still under the snorkel hood) and **Partner #2** records their observations.
4. **Partner #1** then measures 3mL of triethylene glycol in a 10mL graduated cylinder and adds it to the vial before mixing the solution with a small stirring rod. 
5. After this, **Partner #2** places the vial back in the aluminum heating block, still on top of the hotplate, setting 6. **Partner #2** will periodically lift the vial up until the fluid changes color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. While **Partner #2** is monitoring the color of the vial, **Partner #1** should use the image to the right to create a vacuum-sealed filtration system (remember to place the filter paper on the bottom of the Buchner funnel)

6. Once the fluid in the vial has reached a reddish-brown color, taking ~20-30 minutes, **Partner #2** removes the vial and place it on a heat-resistant pad until it is cool to the touch (~5 minutes). Meanwhile, **Partner #1** uses a silicone oven mitt to move the hot heat block to a second heat-resistant pad not to be touched for the rest of the lab. After this, **Partner #1** should fill a 250mL beaker with ~50mL of ice (located by elevators) and ~50mL of cold water
7. Once the solution has cooled, **Partner #2** should add 15mL $H_{2}O$, from the 6" test tube in step 1, to the vial. **Partner #1** should record their observations
8. **Partner #2** cools the vial in the ice bath using a utility clamp until a light-yellow solid forms. **Partner #1** should record their observations.
9. **Partner #2** then wets the filter paper with $H_{2}O$ and Sofia turns on the vacuum regulator to pull the filter paper to the bottom of the funnel. 
10. **Partner #1** pours the vial into the filter paper then rinses the vial with $H_{2}O$ to be once again poured in the Büchner funnel
11. **Partner #2** lifts the filter paper out of the funnel and places it on a watch glass then, using a spatula, scrapes the solids and boiling chips back into the vial. **Partner #1** should record their observations
12. Discard the filter paper in the "used filter paper waste"

13. **Partner #1** using a graduated cylinder, measures 5 mL of 10% NaOH and adds it to the vial, stirring to mix, while **Partner #2** measures 5 spatulas of sodium hydrosulfite ($NaHSO_{3}$) and adds it to the vial once **Partner #1** is done stirring the solution. **Partner #1** then washes the walls of the vial with small amounts of $H_{2}O$, stirs it with a stirring rod, and places it back onto the hot plate (no heating block)
14. **Partner #1** turns on the hotplate, setting 3, making sure that the boiling isn't too vigorous. If the fluid begins boiling too much, **Partner #1** uses an oven mitt to lift the vial off the hot plate to cool then places it back. For the next 5 minutes, **Partner #1** uses a glass stirring rod to stir and boil the mixture, then removes the vial with oven mitts to be placed on a heat-resistant pad and records their observations. Meanwhile, **Partner #2** measures 2mL of concentrated acetic acid ($CH_{3}COOH$) using a 10mL graduated cylinder and adds it to the vial once on the heating pad, using a stirring rod to stir
15. Once the vial is cooled to room temperature, **Partner #1** place the vial back into the ice bath, stirring the mixture in the process while a yellow precipitate forms, luminol. **Partner #2** records their observations
16. Under the snorkel hood, **Partner #1** pours the vial back into the vacuum filtration system, collecting the solid luminol on the filter paper in the Büchner funnel then removes the boiling chips from the filter paper with forceps to be thrown in the trash. While **Partner #1** is doing this, **Partner #2** labels a 250mL beaker with "A" where **Partner #1** places the filter paper (with solid luminol) 
17. **Partner #1** adds 5mL of 10% NaOH and 45mL $H_{2}O$ to the beaker then stirs the solution to dissolve the solid luminol. Meanwhile, **Partner #2** labels a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask with "B" and to it they add 10mL of 3% $H_{2}O_{2}$ and 80mL $H_{2}O$
18. Whichever partner finishes first places 1 spatula of potassium ferricyanide ($K_{3}Fe(CN)_{6}$) into a 250mL Erlenmeyer flask
19. Both partners notify Sofia that we're ready and go into a very dark room with an iPad and the solutions. **Partner #1** begins taking a video of **Partner #2**, who simultaneously adds solutions "A" and "B" into the 250mL Erlenmeyer flask, which they swirl to increase the brightness of the reaction. Partners should record their observations and make note of how long the luminescence persists (from the video)
