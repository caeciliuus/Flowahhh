2 distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^3$  determine a unique line (vector equation). Also, one point and a direction also determine a unique line (parametric equation).

Let $\ell$ be the line passing through the point $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ parallel to the nonzero vector $v=\langle a,b,c \rangle$, where $P_{0}$ and $v$ are given. The fixed point $P_{0}$ associated w/ the position vector $r_{0}=\overline{OP_{0}}=\langle x_{0},y_{0},z_{0} \rangle$. We let $P(x,y,z)$ be a variable point on $\ell$ and let $r=\overline{OP}=\langle x,y,z \rangle$ is also parallel to $v$; therefore, $\overline{P_{0}P}=tv$ where $t$ is a real number. By vector addition, we see that $\overline{OP}=\overline{OP_{0}}+\overline{P_{0}P}$ or $\mathbf{\overline{OP}=\overline{OP_{0}}+tv}$
The parameter $t$ determines the location of points on the line, where $t = 0$ corresponds to $P_{0}$

> [!theorem] Equation of a line
> A vector equation of the line passing through the point $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ in the direction of vector $v=\langle a,b,c \rangle$ is $r=r_{0}+tv$ or 
> $$\langle x,y,z \rangle =\langle x_{0},y_{0},z_{0} \rangle +t\langle a,b,c \rangle \text{ for }-\infty<t<\infty$$
> Equivalently, the cooresponding parametric equations of the line are
> $$x=x_{0}+at,y=y_{0}+bt,z=z_{0}+ct \text{ for }=-\infty<t<\infty$$

The parametric equation of a line *segment* is the same as the line, just w/ domain restrictions

> [!theorem] Distance between a point and a line
> The distance $d$ between the point $Q$ and the line $r=r_{0}+tv$ is 
> $$d=\frac{|v\times \vec{PQ}|}{|v|}$$
> where $P$ is any point on the line and $v i$ a vector parallel to the line

1. Check whether the lines are parallel by turning lines into vector equations.
2. Equate the parametric equations (components) to each other to isolate $s$ and $t$. Substitute the determined values back in to see whether a false or true statement results.
	-  If the lines do not intersect, the system generates a false statement and it can be concluded that the lines are skew

A plane is a flat surface with infinite extent in all directions. Three noncollinear points determine a unique plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Also determined by one point in the plane and any nonzero vector orthagonal to the plane. Such a vector, called a *normal vector*, specifies the orientation of the plane.

>[!definition] Plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$
>Given a fixed point $P_{0}$ and a nonzero normal vector $n$, the set of points $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for which $\overline{P_{0}P}$ is orthogonal to n is called a plane

>[!theorem] General equation of a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$
>The plane passing through the point $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ iwith a nonzero normal vector $n=\langle a,b,c \rangle$ is described by the equation
> $$a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0})=0 \text{ or } ax+by+cz=d, \text{ where }d=ax_{0}+by_{0}+cz_{0}$$

The coefficients $a,b,c$ in the equation of a plane determine the orientation of the plane, while the constant term d determines the location of the plane

[find the equation of a plane passing through $P_{0}(2,-3,4)$ with a normal vector $n=\langle -1,2,3 \rangle$]([[Calculus - Early Transcendentals, Third Edition.pdf#page=876|Calculus - Early Transcendentals, Third Edition, p.850]])
- Substituting the components of n and the coordinates of $P_{0}$ into the equation of a plane, we have
$$a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0})=0=(-1)(x-2)+2(y+3)+3(z-4)\to-x+2y+3z=4$$

[find an equation of the plane that passes through the noncollinear points $P(2,-1,3),Q(1,4,0),R(0,-1,5)$]([[Calculus - Early Transcendentals, Third Edition.pdf#page=876|Calculus - Early Transcendentals, Third Edition, p.850]])
- first find $\overline{PR}$ and $\overline{PQ}$ then cross the segments to find the vector normal to the plane:
$$
\mathbf{n} = \overrightarrow{PQ} \times \overrightarrow{PR} = \begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 
-1 & 5 & -3 \\ 
-2 & 0 & 2 
\end{vmatrix} = 10\mathbf{i} + 8\mathbf{j} + 10\mathbf{k}.
$$
- any nonzero scalar multiple of $n$ may be used as the normal vector. choosing $n=\langle 5,4,5 \rangle$ and $P_{0}(2,-1,3)$ as the fixed point in the plane, an equation of the plane is
$$5(x-2)+4(y+1)+5(z-3)=0$$

> [!definition] Parallel and orthogonal planes
> Two distinct planes are parallel if their respective normal vectors are parallel (that is, the normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other). Two planes are orthogonal if their respective normal vectors are orthogonal (that is, the dot product of the normal vectors is zero).

To find the intersection of two planes, calculate a point in which they intercept (e.g letting $z=0$) then find the direction vector of the parametric equation by crossing the two planes (cross product)
